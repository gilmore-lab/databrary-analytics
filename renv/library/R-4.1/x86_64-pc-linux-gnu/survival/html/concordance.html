<h2>Compute the concordance statistic for data or a model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The concordance statistic compute the agreement between an observed
response and a predictor.  It is closely related to Kendall's tau-a and
tau-b, Goodman's gamma, and Somers' d, all of which can also be
calculated from the results of this function.
</p>

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>a fitted model or a formula.  The formula should be of
the form <code>y ~x</code>  or <code>y ~ x + strata(z)</code> with a single
numeric or survival response and a single predictor.
Counts of concordant, discordant and tied pairs 
are computed separately per stratum, and then added.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
the <code>formula</code>, or in the <code>subset</code> and the <code>weights</code>
argument. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>optional vector of case weights.
Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>

<p>expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in 
the fit.   Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>

<p>a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the model.frame
after any subset argument has been used.  Default is
<code>options()\$na.action</code>. Only applicable if <code>object</code> is a formula.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>multiple fitted models are allowed.  Only applicable if
<code>object</code> is a model object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, a new data frame in which to evaluate (but
not refit) the models</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cluster</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional grouping vector for calculating the robust
variance</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ymin, ymax</code></td>
<td>
<p>compute the concordance over the restricted range
ymin &lt;= y &lt;= ymax.  (For survival data this is a time range.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timewt</code></td>
<td>
<p>the weighting to be applied.  The overall statistic is a
weighted mean over event times.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>influence</code></td>
<td>
<p>1= return the dfbeta vector, 2= return the full
influence matrix, 3 = return both
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ranks</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, return a data frame containing the
scaled ranks that make up the overall score.  
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>reverse</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE then assume that larger <code>x</code> values predict
smaller response values <code>y</code>; a proportional hazards model is
the common example of this, larger hazard = shorter survival.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timefix</code></td>
<td>
<p>correct for possible rounding error.  See the
vignette on tied times for more explanation. Essentially, exact ties
are an important part of the concordance computatation, but &quot;exact&quot;
can be a subtle issue with floating point numbers.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keepstrata</code></td>
<td>
<p>either TRUE, FALSE, or an integer value.
Computations are always done within stratum, then added. If the
total number of strata greater than <code>keepstrata</code>, or
<code>keepstrata=FALSE</code>, those subtotals are not kept in the output.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The concordance is an estimate of
<i>Pr(x[i] &lt; x[j] | y[i] &lt; y[j])</i>,
for a model fit replace <i>x</i> with <i>yhat</i>, the
predicted response from the model.
For a survival outcome some pairs of values
are not comparable, e.g., censored at time 5 and a death at time 6,
as we do not know if the first observation will or will not outlive
the second.  In this case the total number of evaluable pairs is smaller.
</p>
<p>A naive compuation requires adding up over all n(n-1)/2 comparisons,
which can be quite slow for large data sets.
This routine uses an O(n log(n)) algorithm.
At each uncensored event time y, compute the rank of x for the subject
who had the event as compared to the x values for all others with a longer
survival, where the rank has value between 0 and 1.
The concordance is a weighted mean of these ranks,
determined by the <code>timewt</code> option. The rank vector can be
efficiently updated as subjects are added to the risk set.
For further details see the vignette.
</p>
<p>The <code>timewt</code> option is only applicable to censored data.  In this
case the default corresponds to Harrell's C statistic, which is
closely related to the Gehan-Wilcoxon test;
<code>timewt="S"</code> corrsponds to the Peto-Wilcoxon,
<code>timewt="S/G"</code> is suggested by Schemper, and
<code>timewt="n/G2"</code> corresponds to Uno's C.
It turns out that the Schemper and Uno weights are computationally
identical, we have retained both option labels as a user convenience.
The <code>timewt= "I"</code> option is related to the log-rank
statistic.
</p>
<p>Relatations to other statistics:
For continuous x and y, 2C- 1 is equal to Somers' d.
If the response is binary, C is equal to the area under the reciever
operating curve or AUC.
For a survival response and binary predictor C is the numerator of
the Genan-Wilcoxon test.
</p>
<p>When the number of strata is very large, such as in a conditional
logistic regression for instance (<code>clogit</code> function), a much
faster computation is available when the individual strata results
are not retained; use <code>keepstrata=FALSE</code> or <code>keepstrata=0</code>
to do so. In the general case the <code>keepstrata = 10</code>
default simply keeps the printout managable: it retains and prints
per-strata information if the number of strata is &lt;= 10.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>concordance</code> containing the following
components:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">

</td></tr>

<td>
<p>optional, the vector of leverage estimates for the
concordance</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>influence</code></td>

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ranks</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional, a data frame containing the Somers' d rank

</td></tr>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A coxph model that has a numeric failure may have undefined
predicted values, in which case the concordance will be NULL.
</p>
<p>Computation for an existing coxph model along with <code>newdata</code> has
some subtleties with respect to extra arguments in the original call.
These include
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> tt() terms in the model.  This is not supported with newdata.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> subset.  Any subset clause in the original call is ignored,
i.e., not applied to the new data.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> strata() terms in the model.  The new data is expected to
have the strata variable(s) found in the original data set,
with concordance computed within strata.
The levels of the strata variable need not be
the same as in the original data.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> id or cluster directives.  This has not yet been sorted out.
</p>
</li></ul>
