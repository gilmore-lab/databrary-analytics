<h2>
Multi-state Proportional Hazards Regression Object 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This class of objects is returned by the <code>coxph</code> class of functions 
to represent a fitted hazards model, when the model has
multiple states.  The object inherits from the <code>coxph</code> class.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>states</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector listing the states in the model</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cmap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the coefficient map. A matrix containing
a column for each transition and a row for each coefficient, the value
maps that transition/coefficient pair to a position in the coefficient
vector.
If a particular covariate is not used by a transition the matrix
will contain a zero in that position, if two transitions share a
coefficient the matrix will contain repeats.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>smap</code></td>
<td>
<p>the stratum map.
The row labeled &lsquo;(Baseline)&rsquo; identifies transitions that do or do not
share a baseline hazard.  Further rows correspond to strata() terms
in the model, each of which may apply to some transitions and not others.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rmap</code></td>
<td>
<p>mapping for the residuals and linear predictors.  A two
column matrix with one row for each element of the vectors
and two columns, the first contains the data row and the second the
transition.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a multi-state model a set of intermediate observations is created
during the computation, with a separate set of data rows for each
transition.  An observation (id and time interval) that is at risk for
more than one transition will for instance have a linear predictor and
residual for each of the potential transitions.  As a result the vector
of linear predictors will be longer than the number of observations.
The <code>rmap</code> matrix shows the mapping.
</p>


<h3>Components</h3>

<p>The object has all the components of a <code>coxph</code> object, with the
following additions and variations.
