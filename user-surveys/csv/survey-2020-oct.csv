I think even if it had only a couple of these features, I would reuse the data store in the repository. ","As an early career researcher, I have a lot of questions in my mind that need answers but I have very limited resources. Some of my questions can be answered through thorough behaviour coding of free play sessions between caregivers and children, if I have access to a data set that has free play sessions and did not look at the questions I am looking to investigate, it would be great resource for me. It would save me from a lot of effort in data collection which would basically end up with the same output, financial burden associated with data collection. Additionally, it could spark collaborations with the owners of the original data and it is always good to network with other people that have more experience in the field. Finally, in some populations (infants, atypically developing children, old people), it is very costly and time consuming to collect data, if a particular data set can answer a lot of questions, why not do it? ","It is a lot of work to format every single data point to share. Some people don't want to share data with the hope that they can recycle it someday for a project that they will never do. Sometimes there are some restrictions regarding GDPR compliance or funding requirements. However, if there are not external factors, and if the data sharing is not effortful, I think more people would be motivated to share.",d.karadag@lancaster.ac.uk,,

First, when I look at a collection that involves a very long list of videos, databrary does not ""keep track"" of where I was. So when I view a video that is (for example) video 80 in the list, when I go back to the list, it only shows the first rows, and I have to re-open and re-navigate the rest of the list. This has discouraged me from scrolling through existing data and has caused me problems with maintaining and updating my own data. Second, uploading data is challenging. The inflexibility of some of the fields and the inability to upload multiple videos at a time has been discouraging. I often find that my students put off uploading videos because of these limitations, and then the task is overwhelming. Third, it is not obvious whether or how to delete volumes.

Someone else writing papers/grants off of their materials without citation/paid collaboration detracts from what they can accomplish from their own work which early career researchers are LEAST able to take risks on. Secondary analyses are important but there does need to be a culture shift to alleviate the publish/grant writing or perish pressure while formally acknowledging the foundational work of those who collect the data.

For example, if I could upload a data frame and R code so that they could examine the code, run it, and verify my findings.  I've spoken with Rick Gilmore about some of my concerns regarding giving away my data that I have spent hundreds of hours and many years accumulating and using to advance my research program.  I'm 100% comfortable with others ""checking my work"" but I am less enthusiastic about doing the hard work of planning a study, getting IRB approval, collecting data, etc., only to hand it over to someone so they can avoid all of those steps.  And, there is an added layer of complexity when the data are collected from private organizations that have additional restrictions on data sharing--even if it is anonymous.","Strong search functions that make it easy to find relevant data.  I also REALLY like the idea of having researchers post videos of their experimental manipulations; walking through illustrative data collection protocols; etc.  I think much of the failure to replicate/extend research FINDINGS may be attributed to failure to correctly replicate/extend the nuances of research PROTOCOLS.  Of course, if one's protocols are so finicky, that draws into question the generalizability of the findings.  In any event, I would personally be very comfortable posting ""training"" videos on data collection protocols; experimental manipulations; etc. etc. ","Free data saves me from having to go through the trouble of IRB, training RAs, collecting data, screening/cleaning, etc.  ","As I noted above, I am 100% comfortable sharing my data for verification purposes -- i.e., so that others can confirm a) I am not incompetent, or b) I am not selectively reporting data screening protocols or otherwise massaging data to get the results I want to find. 

However, from a basic reciprocity and equity perspective, I am not comfortable spending hundreds of hours (often times years) collecting data only to give it a way so that others can circumvent going through similar data collection activities (fighting with IRB, training staff, watching staff turnover, training new staff, actually collecting data, reporting problematic issues back to IRB, ammending IRBs, fighting for subject pool hours, paying participants or paying for access to copyrighted assessments (or navigating agreements with testing companies to get fees waived or reduced), etc. etc. etc.).  

So, I guess that means I am an avowed selfish scientist concerned about ""what's in it for me""?  

Do I get to quarantine certain ideas so that others can't test them using my data before I have an opportunity to do so?  Will I be listed as a co-author on all papers using my data? Will my citation count and h-index be adjusted to take into account papers that I didn't publish but that are based on my ideas and data?  Will I be co-awarded an ""early career contributions award"" along side any young scholars who earn such an award by milking data sets that make publicly available?  Will I be provided summer salary on the grant someone else receives, in part because they used my data as pilot data in their NIH application?  

I know we like to think that science is a team sport -- it isn't.  Science is a competitive venture; just like business.  Apple doesn't openly share its data and ideas with Microsoft. So, while it is a laudable goal to try and create a collective mindset in the research community, science has always been an individual sport -- especially in the US (which has an extremely individualistic culture; and thus, a reward system that favors individual accomplishments).  

However, even our European colleagues see science as largely an individual activity -- the maximum number of ""team members"" who may be awarded a Nobel prize is 3; if you happen to work with a 4th person, then the Nobel committee get's to decide which of you is not deserving of the award.  Likewise, distinguished career awards and early career awards are awarded to individual scientists, not teams.  Fellowship status in professional societies is awarded to individual scientists, not teams. Individuals, not teams, are asked to serve as the editor-in-chief of (99% of) scientific journals. Individuals, not teams, serve as program officers at grant agencies...etc.

If we are going to translate science into a ""team sport"" then ALL of the rewards for success should be distributed among the members of the ""team.""  

Sorry for making you read my selfish rant :)","Two closing points.  

1. As noted above, I REALLY like the idea of encouraging researchers to post videos of them describing and illustrating their experimental manipulations and/or research protocols -- perhaps including an example of data collection (even it is really just an RA as the subject).  This would dramatically expand the use and visibility of databrary b/c even scholars who were NOT using video-based methods, would still post their protocols at databrary.  

2. I would STRONGLY encourage you to broaden the scope of your audience.  My background is in I/O psychology. While there is limited use of videos in my field, there are associated fields that would benefit greatly from Databrary.  For example, within the field of Management, video-based research methods are becoming more and more popular.  When I was the editor of a Organizational Research Methods, I published a special issue on Video-Based Methods in Organizational Research (2018; volume 2).  At a minimum, you might consider contacting the guest editors and authors of those papers to encourage them to visit and consider using Databrary.  Similarly, their are areas in communication sciences (e.g., organizational comm) that might not know about databrary. However, after learning about it they might see it as a very useful tool in their work.

Happy to discuss any of these points further.

2) my own personal reason is because privacy requirements of different countries and fear that if data sharing was included in consent forms, one might lose participants, especially if consents are distributed in schools and daycares and researchers cannot discuss these with parents. Because I don't live in the US, and because the Patriot Act in the US gives sweeping powers to government to access private user information, all confidential data collected by researchers in our province must be stored on Canadian servers. If I want to upload data or videos to databrary, I would have to inform parents that I would be making their children's data/videos available publicly world wide (i.e. the restrictions provided by databrary to make data available only to other researchers would not be considered secure enough given our provincial data privacy laws and the Patriot Act)","It would be great if Databrary looked into and provided information/webinars on machine learning video analysis (this may already be available, but I haven't seen ads about this in listservs)
